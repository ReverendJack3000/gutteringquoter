# Document issues that might recur

When we get stuck on an issue that is likely to come up again (e.g. environment quirks, dependency problems, API gotchas, or non-obvious fixes), document it so the project can recover faster next time.

**Where to document:** Add or update an entry in **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** in the project root.

**Each entry should include:**
- **Symptom / context:** What we were doing and what went wrong (error message, behaviour).
- **Cause (if known):** Why it happened (e.g. Python version, path, missing env).
- **Fix / workaround:** Exact steps or code that resolved it (or a link to the fix).
- **Optional:** One-line title and date so entries are easy to scan.

After adding or updating `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, continue with the original task. Do not remove or overwrite existing entries unless they are obsolete or incorrect.
