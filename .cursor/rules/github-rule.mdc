# Git Branch Discipline

We operate with a single active feature branch at a time.

## Core Rules

- Never have more than ONE `feature/*` branch alive at a time.
- If a feature branch already exists, finish it or delete it before starting another.
- `main` must always remain stable and merge-ready.

## Before Implementing a New Feature

1. Run:
   git branch

2. If on `main`, create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/<short-feature-name>

3. If already on a `feature/*` branch:
   - Confirm it matches the task being worked on.
   - If not, stop and resolve before proceeding.

4. Update the top of `TASK_LIST.md` to include:

## 🔁 Current Working Branch
- Branch: feature/<short-feature-name>
- Based on: main
- Status: In Progress
- Related Tasks:
  - [ ] <task reference>

## When Feature Is Complete

1. Mark related tasks as [x] in TASK_LIST.md.
2. Commit changes.
3. Merge into main.
4. Delete the feature branch.
5. Update TASK_LIST.md to:

## 🔁 Current Working Branch
- Branch: main
- Status: Stable
