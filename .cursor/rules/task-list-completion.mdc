# Task list completion

- **Single source of truth:** All task tracking for this project lives in **`TASK_LIST.md`** (index: branch, uncompleted table, locked decisions, "Where to look" map) and the **section files in `docs/tasks/`** (full task text and checkboxes). Do not create or maintain a separate task list elsewhere.

- **Where to look:** Use the "Where to look (RAG-style)" tables at the top of `TASK_LIST.md` to find which file contains a given section (e.g. Section 54 → `docs/tasks/section-54.md`).

- **Marking completion:** When a task is done, open the **section file** that contains that task (see `TASK_LIST.md` tables) and change the checkbox to **checked** (`[x]`):
  - Before: `- [ ] **1.1** Create project folder structure`
  - After:  `- [x] **1.1** Create project folder structure`
  If a section becomes fully complete and its row should be removed from the uncompleted table, update **`TASK_LIST.md`** (the index) to remove that row.

- Prefer lowercase `x` in `[x]` for compatibility with common markdown checklists.

- If you complete multiple tasks in one change, update every corresponding checkbox in the **relevant section file(s)** in the same edit, and the index uncompleted table if needed.
