# Task list completion

- **Single source of truth:** All task tracking for this project lives in `TASK_LIST.md`. Do not create or maintain a separate task list (e.g. in other markdown files or comments) for the same work.

- **Marking completion:** When a task (or subtask) from `TASK_LIST.md` is done, update that line so the checkbox is **checked** by putting an **X** inside the square brackets:
  - Before: `- [ ] **1.1** Create project folder structure`
  - After:  `- [x] **1.1** Create project folder structure`

- Prefer lowercase `x` in `[x]` for compatibility with common markdown checklists.

- If you complete multiple tasks in one change, update every corresponding checkbox in `TASK_LIST.md` in the same edit.
